# ToDo

- make it so this works for a table you aren't a part of (switch how process move works if you don't enter the first cards)
- loading wheel
- so much validation (see Flask error handling)
- remove try/except in class_board
- safer password handling
- collapsable login
- read 2 first cards from page
